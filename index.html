        Living life is easy. Enjoying life in all it's facets can be a challange. But it doesn't have to be with right perspective.
        <p>Not right as in "I'm right and you're wrong", but more what is the truth beind what is going on. Truth is not subjective, it simply is what is in this, the only, and every present moment.</p>
        <p> In the end the source of everything is you. You are the reason you have your feelings, you are the tool in which the world is in the perceptional suit you're wearing. </p>
        <p>Don't try to be different. You're perfectly created for the exact purpose of experiential existance. Your job is to simply experience this 'curiculum of human-hood'. How you choose to percieve the lesson in this world is your choice.</p>
